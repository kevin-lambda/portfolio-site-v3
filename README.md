notes

- img tag in nextjs. img tags will only? look at files in the public folder.
  - also... setting a src path starting with "/" means it will start at the root?
  - anyway for nextjs img tag, use <img src="/imageFileName.jpg"/>
  - BUT, if want to use an external image with the <Image/> component ... need to add the domain of the external image to next.config.js stuff...
